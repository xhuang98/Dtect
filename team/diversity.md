Diversity in Dtect
---
Diversity is a very broad term, and comes in many forms such as gender, race, cultural background, past experiences, socioeconomic status, etc. All these are part of what defines us as who we are, as well as what contributes to what we do and how we think. Society is made up of every single one of us diverse individuals, each different in our own way. Having diversity improves productivity, increases points of view, incites creativity, etc. One can say it is simply ignorant to disregard the impactful existence of diversity. Building a start-up company in the field of user behaviour analytics, it is our duty, in favour of not only the team dynamic but also our business perspectives, to assess our team’s strengths and weaknesses by exploring our diversity along with responsibility of inclusion. 


Team Background
---

Diversity can be found within our team in a variety of areas. Our team brings a wide range of different skills from both the technology and business fields. 

### Strengths in Diversity
In terms of software development, our team members have professional experience in developing APIs, mobile/web apps, infrastructures and architectures, as well as in quality assurance. Our past employments include both start-ups and large corporations. Working for large corporations exposed us to in-depth knowledge of our specific occupations due to its rigorous structure, whereas working for start-ups provided us with the fast-paced, smaller-scaled working environment which we will experience in developing this project. In addition, our past employments have come from a variety of industries, such as banking, investment, various fields of technology, and food service. 

Business-wise, we have members who have been involved in both business development and project management. Those who have not had business related jobs have contributed to project management and communicated to stakeholders which is especially important for running a start-up. 

Our team consists of three males and two females where four are undergraduate students and one has completed a master's degree. Additionally, our team members have living experiences in many countries. The mix of different age and gender groups along with knowledge of different cultures ensures that each of our team members have life experiences that are different from others, which, combined with the unique work experiences, leads to us having different perspectives and opinions. This is crucial to the development of any project. 

### Weaknesses in Diversity
Diversity is a multi-dimensional spectrum. It is not contradicting to say that despite of the diversity in our group, our diversity is still limited. Quite the opposite, we need to acknowledge our weaknesses. 

Although our team members all have experience managing projects, most of us have not had any industry experience in leadership roles. We may not have experience to all technical aspects of building this current product. In addition, most of the team members are undergraduate students and are relatively in the early stages of our careers, which means that our exposure to the industry is limited. 

While our team has taken many courses related to statistics and AI, we have little professional industry experience in the data science role. This does not necessarily mean we are not able to tackle an AI challenge; however, this may be the first time that we will apply our data science knowledge to run a business product. 

As a team of five, it is inevitable that we are not be able to represent every diversity group and it is important to recognize the lacking areas of diversity in our team. Firstly, our team consists of UofT computer science students. By studying at the same university in the same program, we are likely to have taken courses from the same professors. As a result, we may have the same unconscious bias in some areas of our education. Additionally, our members' limited past work locations (mainly Toronto, with some locations in Europe and Asia) may restrict our knowledge of the culture and industry in the other parts of the world. Our team members are also relatively in the same age group, so we could lack perspective of the other age groups and how they behave which is especially important for our product. 


### Diversity effects on the Company 

In general, lack of diversity leads to lack of perspectives in the company which can lead to certain populations not being considered while developing the product. In the case of this project, lack of diversity, specifically the lack of representations from certain racial and nationality groups in the team, can lead to customers from these groups being under-represented in the ideas that we come up with. For this project, the customers are corporations. Our limited knowledge on how corporations from certain nations and cultures operate might make it more difficult for our product to connect with potential customers in those nations and cultures. Limited diversity in professional experience may lead to ineffective marketing towards parts of the target market. Other negative effects that could be a consequence of lack of diversity include having products that are not accessible to certain users, assumptions on how consumer groups interpret and use products. 

As a specific example, in user behaviour analytics, we may need to take consideration in types of user behavioural patterns that could be influenced by cultural events when assessing behaviour. Limited diversity in professional experience would affect us as well because diverse work culture and vision between companies can also influence the workers’ activities within the workplace.  

Our vision is to provide a flexible solution that fits many organizations. Members from other diverse groups can bring other essential skills and expertise to the team including constructing software architecture, data science, business management etc. The broadened technical skill set allows the team to consider more possible directions that the product can take while the business and management skills that are brought in can make sure that rigorous plans are developed and executed properly. Furthermore, individuals whose life experiences are different from the current members of the team due to their unique fit in the areas of diversity can introduce a new perspective and provide creativity in product development.  People from cultural groups that are not represented in our team can also help the team get insight into how our solution can attract organizations from the areas where these cultural groups are prevalent. In addition, members of other diverse groups may help with connecting with marginalized communities, further building allies and introducing conversations. 

### Filling the Gap

Many of us have previously worked with data scientists and managers. By collecting our observations of those roles as fellow co-workers, our team can discuss how to carry on those roles, which strategies worked and didn’t work, etc. We seek for advice from professors, graduate students, co-workers and colleagues who have more experience in the field when needed. 

As for leading a start-up, we can use our existing diversity to invent our ways to run a start-up that works well for our team. Since no one has previous experience, our team is especially open to integrating diverse opinions. Every company is run differently and started in different ways with people coming from different backgrounds. Our team is no exception and our lack of experience in this domain means we will not be influenced into trying to copy another company. As such, we are using this disadvantage to our advantage. 

Building on the previous points, any skill that is unfamiliar our team should be done by the team altogether to ensure that ideas are gone through as many perspectives as possible to avoid potential problems. Our team prioritizes inclusion over anything else. Every member is free to voice their opinion no matter what level of experience they have in that topic and it will be respected and considered by rest of the team. 

To maximize our effort in making up to our weaknesses in diversity in the team, we ought to consult a wider range of voices and keep our eyes open during the entire process of building our product and servicing our clients. 

We understand that we will make mistakes at the beginning, but our team will learn from them and improve. Although our team is quite diverse, we have one thing in common: motivation to grow.
